CI Config for universal control over our wordpress ci configurations
==
This repository contains the common elements which are included in our repositories but may require tweaking as we test.  For instance the exclusion or inclusion of core standard tests, or whitelisting code sniffer rulesets.

The goal is to ensure that repositories do not require maintenance in order to have a change applied to ci testing.
